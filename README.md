# 🦇 DC Comics E-commerce - PHP Web Project

Welcome to the repository of my **DC Comics-inspired E-commerce** project! 💥

This project was built using **pure PHP**, where I focused on deepening my understanding of **arrays** and object manipulation. I created a `Product` object and learned how to convert it into an array using PHP functions — all while simulating a comic book store featuring iconic DC heroes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PHP** (no frameworks)
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript** (basic interactivity)
- Data organization using **Arrays** and **Object to Array conversion**

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

During the development process, I explored and strengthened key concepts:

- Creating and managing **multidimensional arrays**
- Converting **objects into arrays** using native PHP functions
- Categorizing and organizing product data
- Structuring logic for a simple E-commerce system
- Practicing **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in PHP
- Dynamically integrating layout with data
